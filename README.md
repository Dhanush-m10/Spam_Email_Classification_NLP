📧 Spam Email Classification using NLP

A Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) based project that classifies emails or messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)** using text analysis techniques.

📌 Project Overview

Spam emails are a common problem in digital communication.  
This project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** to automatically detect whether a given email or message is spam.

The model is trained using a labeled dataset of spam and non-spam messages and deployed using a **Streamlit web application** for real-time user interaction.

🚀 Features

- Classifies emails/messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam**
- Uses NLP techniques for text preprocessing
- Machine Learning model trained using Naive Bayes
- Interactive web interface using Streamlit
- Beginner-friendly and end-to-end ML project
